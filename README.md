## Farmers market is a basic web-app building excercise
### Tasks
+ Use the USDA API to fetch farmers market near the user (by 5 digit Zip Code or Lat,Lng GPS coordinates).
+ On a user event or receipt of fetch/AJAX request display the results in a table accesible to the user.
+ Populate the map with results or plot points.

### This is a general excercise for leveraging Map APIs.
You can use Mapquest, Google or any other map API.

Note: you will receive an error for an unsafe script source because the keys are loading from my personal web site.  
I can assure you there is nothing fishy going on here, but posting an actual API key on GitHub is bad practice.
<code>console.log(apiKeys)</code> will show you the object that is loading.
